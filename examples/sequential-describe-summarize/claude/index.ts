/**
 * Sequential two-stage workflow — the canonical `s.save()` / `s.transcript()`
 * handoff pattern.
 *
 * Stage 1 ("describe") writes a detailed paragraph, persists it via `s.save()`,
 * and returns a `SessionHandle`. Stage 2 ("summarize") reads that handle's
 * transcript from disk via `s.transcript(handle)` and produces a condensed
 * summary. This is the bread-and-butter handoff between stages in Atomic.
