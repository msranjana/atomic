/**
 * Review/fix loop — the quintessential harness pattern.
 *
 * Produce a draft, then loop: review → (if verdict is `needs_fix`) fix.
 * Bounded by `max_iterations`, with early exit when the review comes back
 * `clean`. The review stage returns a structured verdict from its callback,
 * which becomes `handle.result` on the returned `SessionHandle` — that's how
 * the surrounding TypeScript reads the LLM's answer and decides whether to
 * keep looping.
 *
 * Note the handoff pattern: `lastHandle` tracks whichever stage produced the
 * currently-valid draft (either the seed or the most recent fix). Each review
 * reads `s.transcript(lastHandle)` to see the latest draft; each fix reads
 * the latest draft AND the review feedback to make a revision. This keeps
 * the loop's information flow explicit.
