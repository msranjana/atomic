/**
 * Two-stage workflow that exercises the OpenCode HIL (human-in-the-loop)
 * detection path. Stage 1 tells the agent to ask the user for their
 * favorite color; the runtime subscribes to the event stream and should
 * flip the stage's node card to the blue "awaiting_input" pulse on
 * `question.asked`, then back to `running` on `question.replied` /
 * `question.rejected`. Stage 2 reads stage 1's transcript and writes
 * a short description of the chosen color.
