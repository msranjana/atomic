 * Two-stage workflow that exercises the Copilot HIL (human-in-the-loop)
 * detection path. Stage 1 tells the agent to use its `ask_user` tool to
 * ask the user for their favorite color; the runtime subscribes to the
 * session's `tool.execution_start` / `tool.execution_complete` events
 * and should flip the stage's node card to the blue "awaiting_input"
 * pulse while the question is unresolved. Stage 2 reads stage 1's
 * transcript and writes a short description of the chosen color.
