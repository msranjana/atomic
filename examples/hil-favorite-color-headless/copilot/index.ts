 * Headless variant of hil-favorite-color (Copilot).

 * Tells the agent to use its `ask_user` tool, but runs the stage with
 * `headless: true`. The runtime appends `ask_user` to the session's
 * `excludedTools`, so the tool is unavailable and the agent must
 * answer directly.
 *
 * Expected: stage completes in seconds with a written answer.
 * Regression: without the fix, the stage hangs forever waiting on a
 * human that never arrives.
