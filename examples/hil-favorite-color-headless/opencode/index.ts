/**
 * Headless variant of hil-favorite-color (OpenCode).
 *
 * Tells the agent to ask the user a question, but runs the stage with
 * `headless: true`. The runtime scopes `OPENCODE_CLIENT=sdk` around the
 * SDK spawn so OpenCode excludes its `question` tool from the registry
 * (upstream only registers it when OPENCODE_CLIENT is "app"/"cli"/"desktop").
 * With no question tool available, the agent must answer directly.
 *
 * Expected: stage completes in seconds with a written answer.
 * Regression: without the fix, the stage hangs forever on the
 * `question.asked` event that no human will ever reply to.
