 * Headless variant of hil-favorite-color (Claude).

 * Tells the agent to use its AskUserQuestion tool, but runs the stage
 * with `headless: true`. The runtime injects `disallowedTools:
 * ["AskUserQuestion"]` into the SDK options, so the tool call is
 * rejected and the agent must answer directly.
 *
 * Expected: stage completes in seconds with a written answer.
 * Regression: without the fix, the stage hangs forever waiting on a
 * human that never arrives.
