## 1. Executive Summary

`pi-workflows` is a **pi-coding-agent extension that adds multi-stage workflow runs**. It is the direct architectural sibling of `pi-subagents`, `pi-mcp-adapter`, and `pi-intercom`: a self-contained pi extension, distributed as an npm package, installable via `pi install npm:pi-workflows`. Anyone running plain `pi` can adopt it.

A workflow is a TypeScript file that `export default`s a compiled `WorkflowDefinition` produced by `defineWorkflow(name).run(fn).compile()`. The extension registers one `workflow` tool the LLM can call, a `/workflow` slash command surface the user can drive directly, an above-editor progress widget, an on-demand overlay for the full DAG, and per-event inline rendering in the chat scroll via `pi.registerMessageRenderer`.

The package depends at runtime on **`pi-subagents`** (workflow stages can dispatch sub-agents for isolated context) and **`pi-mcp-adapter`** (workflow stages have access to whatever MCP servers the user has configured). It optionally integrates with **`pi-intercom`** so workflow stages can ask the user blocking questions while a run is detached. None of these dependencies are forked or modified; `pi-workflows` consumes their public extension surfaces via `pi.events` and tool calls.

This spec stands on its own: `pi-workflows` is developed, tested, and shipped to npm **independently of Atomic**, against any installed pi binary. The sibling Atomic spec then declares `pi-workflows` (alongside the other three) in Atomic's default `packages: [...]` and adds Atomic-curated content (skills, MCP server configs, sub-agent definitions, prompts, themes).

This is a **clean-slate authorship from an empty repo**. Before any code in this spec lands, the repository tree is wiped to documentation only. The previous Atomic codebase's `packages/atomic-sdk/` is cross-referenced for design intent only via **git history** — those files do not exist as files in the working tree by the time Phase A starts. Nothing is migrated, nothing is read, nothing is partially refactored. See §2.4 below for the exact starting tree.

---

## 2. Context and Motivation

### 2.1 Why pi-workflows

Pi (`@bastani/atomic`) is a minimal coding TUI that explicitly **does not ship workflow orchestration** (see pi `docs/usage.md` philosophy section). Users who want plan/build/review loops, fan-out research scouts, or multi-stage agent pipelines either build their own glue or install third-party extensions. `pi-workflows` is one such extension — Atomic's primary contribution to the pi ecosystem.

The workflow design pattern is mature: a definition declares input schemas and a function that issues `ctx.stage()` calls (sequential, parallel, or fan-in topology); the runtime infers the DAG from JavaScript execution order; each stage spawns a focused pi sub-session driven by `session.prompt()`; live progress streams to a widget; the user can interrupt, branch via `/tree`, or detach. The previous Atomic implementation proved the design works; this extension is its clean reauthorship as a pi-native artifact.

### 2.2 Relationship to siblings

| Sibling          | What it adds                                            | How pi-workflows uses it                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pi-subagents`   | Delegated child agents via the `subagent` tool          | Stages call `subagent({agent, task})` for context-isolated work — same flow a chat user gets when they type `/run`.       |
| `pi-mcp-adapter` | MCP server proxy / direct-tool registration             | Stages inherit pi's tool list including MCP tools; the integration glue may toggle per-stage server availability.        |
| `pi-intercom`    | Child↔parent coordination (optional companion)          | When present, workflow stages running detached can `contact_supervisor` to ask the user blocking questions.              |

The dependency direction is one-way: `pi-workflows` declares them as runtime peer-deps and degrades gracefully if absent. None of the siblings depend on `pi-workflows`.

### 2.3 Design reference: previous Atomic SDK (git history only)

The v0.x `packages/atomic-sdk/` codebase encoded most of the workflow design that this extension reauthors. Specific files are cross-referenced throughout this spec **only via git history** — they do not exist as files in the working tree once Phase A starts. The previous implementation is preserved at the `atomic-pi-rewrite` repo at refs/tags prior to the clean-slate wipe described in §2.4.

The most load-bearing v0.x cross-references (read via `git show <commit>:packages/atomic-sdk/src/...`):

- `packages/atomic-sdk/src/define-workflow.ts` — the fluent authoring DSL shape.
- `packages/atomic-sdk/src/registry.ts` — immutable chainable registry semantics.
- `packages/atomic-sdk/src/runtime/graph-inference.ts` — `GraphFrontierTracker` topology inference algorithm (the only non-trivial algorithm worth preserving in spirit).
- `packages/atomic-sdk/src/types.ts` — the public type surface.
- `packages/atomic-sdk/src/runtime/status-writer.ts` — `WorkflowStatusSnapshot` schema.
- `packages/atomic-sdk/src/components/{session-graph-panel,node-card,edge,header,compact-switcher,toast,layout,connectors,graph-theme,status-helpers,color-utils}.tsx` — the TUI graph engine (see §5.4).

Every line of new code in this extension is written fresh against these references — none is copied.

### 2.4 Repository starting state — wiped to docs only

**Before Phase A of this spec begins, the working tree is wiped.** The first commit on the new branch (call it `rewrite/clean-slate`) deletes everything except documentation. The expected resulting tree:

```
atomic-pi-rewrite/
├── docs/                      # KEEP — any prior product/architecture docs
├── specs/                     # KEEP — this spec and Spec 2
├── research/                  # KEEP — research notes for both specs
├── README.md                  # KEEP — to be rewritten in Spec 2
├── LICENSE                    # KEEP
├── CHANGELOG.md               # KEEP — empty v1 entry seeded
├── AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md      # KEEP if useful; rewritten in Spec 2
├── .gitignore                 # KEEP
├── .editorconfig              # KEEP
└── (everything else: DELETED)
```

What's **deleted** at the wipe commit:

- `packages/` entire directory (atomic, atomic-sdk, anything else).
- `tests/`, `scripts/`, `examples/`, `rest-api/`, `assets/`.
- Build artifacts: `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `bun.lock`, `package-lock.json`.
- Root manifest: `package.json` (will be re-created fresh).
- Lint/build config: `bunfig.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.build.json`, `oxlint.json` (will be re-created fresh per Spec 1's needs).
- Installer scripts: `install.sh`, `install.cmd`, `install.ps1`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/` (rebuilt in Spec 2 for Atomic).
- Devcontainer: `.devcontainer/` (rebuilt minimal in Spec 2).
- Vendor config dirs: `.atomic/`, `.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.github/agents/`, `.agents/`.
- Anything else under the repo root that is not in the KEEP list.

After the wipe, **Phase A of this spec creates `packages/pi-workflows/` and a minimal root `package.json` + `bunfig.toml`/`tsconfig.json` scoped to that single package.** The Atomic packages do not yet exist; they're created in Spec 2.

The git wipe commit message: `chore: clean-slate wipe before v1 rewrite (Spec 1 + Spec 2)`. The commit before it is tagged `v0.x-archive` for git-history cross-references.

## 3. Goals and Non-Goals

### 3.1 Functional Goals

- [ ] **Publishable as npm package `pi-workflows`** (not scoped, following sibling naming).
- [ ] **Single default export** — `function (pi: ExtensionAPI)` — that registers the `workflow` tool, the slash command surface, message renderers, and lifecycle handlers.
- [ ] **Named exports** for the authoring API — `defineWorkflow`, `createRegistry`, types — usable from any TypeScript file that `import`s the package.
- [ ] **`workflow` tool** with `{name, inputs}` parameters and live `renderCall`/`renderResult` slots that show in-flight DAG state.
- [ ] **Slash commands**: `/workflow [name] [args]`, `/workflow:<name>`, `/workflow list/status/kill/resume/inputs`, `/workflows-doctor`.
- [ ] **Above-editor progress widget** via `ctx.ui.setWidget` while runs are in-flight.
- [ ] **On-demand overlay** via `ctx.ui.custom({overlay: true})` showing the full DAG with keyboard navigation.
- [ ] **Per-event inline rendering** in the chat scroll via `pi.registerMessageRenderer` (run banner, stage chips, stage progress, stage results, run summary).
- [ ] **Session-entry persistence** via `pi.appendEntry` so runs survive `/reload`, integrate with `/tree`, `/fork`, and compaction.
- [ ] **DAG execution** with sequential, parallel (`Promise.all`), and fan-in topology inference via the `GraphFrontierTracker` algorithm.
- [ ] **HIL** via pi's `ctx.ui.input/confirm/select/editor` — every workflow stage gets uniform HIL primitives.
- [ ] **Builtin workflows** shipped inside the package's `workflows/` directory: `deep-research-codebase`, `ralph`, `open-claude-design`.
- [ ] **Custom workflow discovery** by direct module import from `.pi/workflows/*.ts`, `~/.pi/agent/workflows/*.ts`, and explicit `workflows: { name: { path } }` settings entries.
- [ ] **`pi-subagents` integration**: stages can spawn sub-agents via the existing `subagent` tool; the integration may inject workflow context (run-id, stage-id) as env vars.
- [ ] **`pi-mcp-adapter` integration**: stages inherit MCP tools transparently; an optional `mcp:<server>:<allow|deny>` directive on a stage toggles a specific server's availability for that stage via `pi.events`.
- [ ] **`pi-intercom` integration**: when present, the workflow run's parent session is registered as the intercom target so detached stages can `contact_supervisor`.
- [ ] **Configuration**: optional `~/.pi/agent/extensions/workflow/config.json` for tunables (recursion depth, default concurrency, persistence on/off).
- [ ] **CLI flag registration** via `pi.registerFlag`: `--workflow=<name>` and `--workflow-input-<key>=<value>` so a `pi -p --workflow=<name>` invocation runs a workflow headlessly. This is the seam Atomic's `atomic workflow` CLI command uses.

### 3.2 Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- [ ] **No tmux integration.** Pi is single-process; nothing in this extension spawns tmux.
- [ ] **No multi-agent CLI dispatch** (claude/copilot/opencode CLIs). Pi's provider abstraction handles all model selection.
- [ ] **No backwards compatibility with `@bastani/atomic-sdk`.** External workflow authors who depended on that import path must update to `import { defineWorkflow } from "pi-workflows"`. No re-export shim.
- [ ] **No `runWorkflow()` programmatic entry point.** Workflows are invoked via (a) the LLM calling the `workflow` tool, (b) a user typing `/workflow ...`, (c) the registered `--workflow=` CLI flag in `pi -p` mode. External Node consumers shell out to pi.
- [ ] **No hidden subcommands** (`_emit-workflow-meta`, `_atomic-run`, etc.). Custom workflows are loaded by direct module import.
- [ ] **No dispatch token** or argv envelope. Module path in settings = user trusts the path.
- [ ] **No bundled MCP servers / skills / agent definitions / prompts / themes / branding.** Those ship with Atomic (the consuming binary), not with this extension. `pi-workflows` is content-neutral.
- [ ] **No Atomic-specific assumptions.** The extension runs against any pi binary including upstream `pi`. Any Atomic-specific behavior (e.g., `ATOMIC_*` env var prefix) is the responsibility of Atomic's piConfig rebrand, which `pi-workflows` benefits from automatically without coding for it.

## 4. Proposed Solution (High-Level Design)

### 4.1 Package architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    User(("User"))
    Pi["pi (any version)"]
    PiWf["pi-workflows<br/>(this package)"]
    PiSa["pi-subagents"]
    PiMcp["pi-mcp-adapter"]
    PiIc["pi-intercom"]
    WfFiles["Workflows<br/>(.ts files with<br/>defineWorkflow exports)"]

    User --> Pi
    Pi --> PiWf
    Pi --> PiSa
    Pi --> PiMcp
    Pi --> PiIc
    PiWf -.->|"subagent tool calls"| PiSa
    PiWf -.->|"event-bus toggles"| PiMcp
    PiWf -.->|"contact_supervisor"| PiIc
    PiWf --> WfFiles
```

`pi-workflows` runs inside pi. Workflows are TypeScript files imported via `jiti`. Sibling extensions are coordinated through `pi.events`, never patched.

### 4.2 Structural parallel to pi-subagents

The two extensions are deliberately isomorphic. This is the design principle.

When tempted to design something on the right that doesn't have an obvious analog on the left, audit first whether we're solving a real new problem or reinventing one pi-subagents already solved.

### 4.3 Package structure — heavy inspiration from `pi-subagents`

The repo layout below mirrors **pi-subagents'** file organization (`nicobailon/pi-subagents`, commit `635112d`) directory-by-directory wherever the concern is shared. Where pi-subagents has `src/agents/` we have `src/workflows/`; where pi-subagents has `src/runs/{foreground,background,shared}/` we have `src/runs/{sync,detach,shared}/`; where pi-subagents has `src/intercom/` we have `src/integrations/intercom/`. Pi-subagents' `tui/render.ts` (55 KB monolith) is our `src/tui/` (split because we port a richer graph engine — see §5.4).

**Pi-subagents structural inspiration is explicit**: every directory that has a clear analog points at the analogous pi-subagents file. The intent is that a reader who knows pi-subagents can immediately find the equivalent piece in `pi-workflows`.

`package.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "pi-workflows",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./dist/extension/index.js"],
    "workflows": ["./workflows"]
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "pi-subagents": "*",
    "pi-mcp-adapter": "*",
    "pi-intercom": "*"
  },
  "peerDependenciesMeta": {
    "pi-subagents":   { "optional": true },
    "pi-mcp-adapter": { "optional": true },
    "pi-intercom":    { "optional": true }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "jiti": "^2.0.0",
    "typebox": "^0.34.0"
  }
}
```

## 5. Detailed Design

### 5.1 Public authoring API

External workflow files look like:

```ts
// my-workflow.ts
import { defineWorkflow } from "pi-workflows";

export default defineWorkflow("deep-research-codebase")
  .description("Scout → per-partition specialists → aggregator")
  .input("prompt", { type: "text", required: true, description: "research question" })
  .input("max_partitions", { type: "number", default: 4 })
  .run(async (ctx) => {
    const scout = await ctx.stage("scout").prompt(`Scout the codebase: ${ctx.inputs.prompt}`);
    const partitions = await ctx.stage("partition").prompt(`Partition based on: ${scout}`);
    const specialists = await Promise.all(
      partitions.split("\n").map((p, i) =>
        ctx.stage(`specialist-${i}`).prompt(`Investigate partition ${p}`)
      )
    );
    const aggregate = await ctx.stage("aggregator").prompt(
      `Aggregate findings:\n${specialists.join("\n---\n")}`
    );
    return { findings: aggregate };
  })
  .compile();
```

`.compile()` returns a frozen `WorkflowDefinition` carrying a sentinel `__piWorkflow: true` so the loader can validate.

**API cross-reference**: v0.x `packages/atomic-sdk/src/define-workflow.ts`. The signature shape is preserved; the implementation is rewritten with no `for(agent)` step (since pi handles model selection via `--model` or `pi.setModel`).

### 5.2 The `workflow` tool

```ts
pi.registerTool({
  name: "workflow",
  label: "workflow",
  description: "Run a defined multi-stage workflow by name.",
  parameters: Type.Object({
    name: Type.String({ description: "Workflow ID (use {action:'list'} to enumerate)" }),
    inputs: Type.Record(Type.String(), Type.Any(), { default: {} }),
    action: Type.Optional(Type.Union([
      Type.Literal("run"), Type.Literal("list"), Type.Literal("status"),
      Type.Literal("kill"), Type.Literal("resume"), Type.Literal("inputs"),
    ])),
  }),
  execute: async (args, ctx) => { /* dispatch by action */ },
  renderCall: ({args}, theme, context) => renderToolCall(args, theme, context),
  renderResult: ({result}, opts, theme, context) => renderToolResult(result, opts, theme, context),
});
```

The tool uses pi-subagents' multi-action-via-discriminator pattern: one tool registration covers run/list/status/kill/resume/inputs. `renderResult` honors `opts.isPartial` to stream live progress (`context.state.runId`, `context.state.stages`, `context.invalidate()`).

### 5.3 Slash commands

| Slash invocation              | Behavior                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/workflow`                   | Opens a `SelectList` overlay with all registered workflows; fuzzy filter.                              |
| `/workflow <name> [args]`     | Starts a run of `<name>` with parsed args (TypeBox-validated inputs).                                  |
| `/workflow:<name>`            | Shorthand for `/workflow <name>`.                                                                       |
| `/workflow list`              | Lists workflows in an overlay (registry inspection).                                                    |
| `/workflow status`            | Lists in-flight runs in an overlay.                                                                     |
| `/workflow kill <runId>`      | Aborts a run (`AbortController.abort()`).                                                               |
| `/workflow kill --all`        | Aborts every in-flight run.                                                                              |
| `/workflow resume <runId>`    | Re-opens the overlay for a specific run.                                                                |
| `/workflow inputs <name>`     | Shows a workflow's input schema in an overlay.                                                          |
| `/workflows-doctor`           | Read-only diagnostics: loaded workflows, available siblings (pi-subagents/pi-mcp-adapter/pi-intercom), config validation. |

Tab-completion via `getArgumentCompletions`.

### 5.4 The TUI graph visualization engine — extends the v0.x Atomic SDK

This is the single largest piece of work in `pi-workflows`. The v0.x Atomic SDK invested heavily in a DAG graph visualization (graph layout, animated edges, status colors, keyboard navigation, switcher popup). **That visualization engine is `pi-workflows`' starting point and the source-of-design.** It is **reauthored against pi-tui** so it can serve double duty as:

1. **An overlay pane** (`ctx.ui.custom({overlay: true})`) — full-screen DAG with keyboard nav, the way Atomic users invoke `atomic workflow` today.
2. **An above-editor widget** (`ctx.ui.setWidget(key, factory, {placement: "aboveEditor"})`) — compact summary version of the same engine sharing the same store, layout math, and theme, so a workflow's progress is visible in-chat without opening the overlay.

The point: **one rendering engine, two presentation modes** — overlay and widget — driven by the same in-extension store. Pi-subagents' `tui/render.ts` (55 KB) is the architectural reference for "one big rendering module shared across presentation contexts."

#### 5.4.1 What we port from the v0.x Atomic SDK

Each file below is **design reference only** — the v0.x packages are deleted (Spec 2 §5.12 "Clean-slate posture"). Pi-workflows re-derives each piece against pi-tui's primitives (`Container`, `Box`, `Text`, `Spacer`, `Markdown`, plus the focusable/overlay machinery in `docs/tui.md`):

The `_panel-contexts.ts` React contexts from v0.x (`StoreContext`, `ThemeContext`, `TmuxSessionContext`, `OffloadManagerContext`) **do not port** — there's no tmux, no offload, no cross-process IPC. The store and theme reach components through pi-tui's natural prop passing.

```

The same `layout.ts` `computeLayout(nodes, opts) → LayoutNode[]` is called by both modes — `opts.viewport` sets the available dimensions, and the engine clips/scales. The same `graph-theme.ts` derivation runs once per theme change. Toggling between overlay and widget does not rebuild the store or recompute layout from scratch.

#### 5.4.3 Overlay invocation

```ts
ctx.ui.custom(
  (tui, theme, keybindings, done) =>
    new GraphView({
      mode: "overlay",
      runId,
      store,
      graphTheme: deriveGraphTheme(theme),
      keybindings,
      onClose: () => done(undefined),
    }),
  {
    overlay: true,
    overlayOptions: { width: "90%", maxHeight: "85%", anchor: "center" },
  }
);
```

`GraphView` is a pi-tui `Component` (`render(width): string[]`, `handleInput(data)`, `invalidate()`). It hosts `header.ts`, the laid-out grid of `node-card.ts` + `edge.ts`, and the `switcher.ts` popup. Dismissable (Escape) without aborting the run. Re-opening: `/workflow status` re-summons.

#### 5.4.4 Widget invocation

```ts
ctx.ui.setWidget("workflow.run", (tui, theme) =>
  new GraphView({
    mode: "widget",
    runId: store.activeRunId(),
    store,
    graphTheme: deriveGraphTheme(theme),
  }), {
    placement: "aboveEditor",
});
```

In `mode: "widget"`, `GraphView.render(width)` returns 1–3 compact lines:

- Line 1: `▶ deep-research-codebase · stage 2/5 (specialist-2) · ⏱ 1m24s`
- Line 2 (optional, when multiple runs): summary count `2 runs in flight — press F2 for overlay`
- Line 3 (optional): a thin per-stage progress sparkline derived from the same `layout.ts` output but compressed to single-row glyphs.

When `store.activeRunId()` returns null (no runs), `setWidget("workflow.run", undefined)` clears it. The store's subscribe callback triggers `setWidget` re-registration on every snapshot change.

#### 5.4.5 Keyboard handoff overlay ↔ widget

Pressing F2 (or `Ctrl+Shift+W`, settings-configurable per `docs/keybindings.md`) from the chat opens the overlay if any runs are in flight. Pressing Escape inside the overlay returns to the chat with the widget visible. The keystrokes are registered via `pi.registerShortcut`.

#### 5.4.6 Pulse animation and live updates

The v0.x panel runs a 60 ms tick that pulses node-card borders for running stages. The same tick runs in `pi-workflows`, scheduled via `setInterval` inside the `GraphView` component's lifecycle (started in the component constructor, cleared on `dispose`). Pi-tui's `invalidate()` is called per tick to redraw only the pulsing nodes (efficient because the layout doesn't recompute).

Tool-execution events (`tool_execution_start/_update/_end`) feed `store.recordToolStart/Update/End(stageId, ...)` which sets the affected node's status; the next tick redraws.

#### 5.4.7 Toasts (overlay-only)

`Toast.tsx` from v0.x renders nvim-style notification cards in the top-right corner with auto-dismiss timers (managed by the store). These appear in the overlay only — in widget mode there's no room. Toast triggers:

- Stage failure (red, 5 s).
- Run completion (green, 3 s).
- Compaction near (yellow, persistent until run ends).
- `contact_supervisor` (blue, persistent until acknowledged) — see §5.10 intercom integration.

### 5.5 Store and in-extension state

`src/store.ts` is a plain mutable object with a `subscribe(fn): unsubscribe` API and an internal version counter. This is the same pattern as v0.x `packages/atomic-sdk/src/components/orchestrator-panel-store.ts` (`PanelStore`) — minus the cross-process IPC layer that pi-subagents and v0.x Atomic both used. Because pi-workflows runs in-process with the chat TUI, the store is just a singleton in the extension module:

```ts
// src/store.ts (sketch)
export interface Store {
  runs(): readonly RunSnapshot[];
  activeRunId(): string | null;
  recordRunStart(run: RunSnapshot): void;
  recordStageStart(runId: string, stage: StageSnapshot): void;
  recordToolStart(runId: string, stageId: string, evt: ToolEvent): void;
  recordToolEnd(runId: string, stageId: string, evt: ToolEvent): void;
  recordStageEnd(runId: string, stage: StageSnapshot): void;
  recordRunEnd(runId: string, status: RunStatus, result?: unknown): void;
  snapshot(): StoreSnapshot;
  subscribe(fn: (snap: StoreSnapshot) => void): () => void;
}
```

**Pi-subagents structural inspiration**: pi-subagents keeps its own per-run state in `src/runs/foreground/subagent-executor.ts` + `src/runs/background/async-job-tracker.ts`. The pi-workflows store is the equivalent — one module owning all live run state.

The store also drives `setWidget` re-registration: every snapshot change calls `setWidget("workflow.run", ...)` to keep the widget current.

### 5.6 Persistence via session entries

```ts
pi.appendEntry("workflow.run.start",     { runId, name, inputs, ts });
pi.appendEntry("workflow.stage.start",   { runId, stageId, name, parentIds, model, ts });
pi.appendEntry("workflow.stage.progress",{ runId, stageId, kind, payload });  // tool calls, message deltas, etc.
pi.appendEntry("workflow.stage.end",     { runId, stageId, status, durationMs, summary });
pi.appendEntry("workflow.run.end",       { runId, status, result, ts });
// optional narrative for the LLM:
pi.appendCustomMessageEntry({ role: "system", content: `Workflow ${name} stage ${stageName} completed: ${summary}` });
```

Each `workflow.run.start` entry is labeled via `pi.setLabel(entryId, "wf:<name>:<short-id>")` for `/tree` bookmark filtering.

Renderers:

```ts
pi.registerMessageRenderer("workflow.run.start",      renderRunBanner);
pi.registerMessageRenderer("workflow.stage.start",    renderStageChip);
pi.registerMessageRenderer("workflow.stage.progress", renderStageProgress);
pi.registerMessageRenderer("workflow.stage.end",      renderStageResult);
pi.registerMessageRenderer("workflow.run.end",        renderRunSummary);
```

On `session_start`, the extension scans `ctx.sessionManager.getEntries()` for in-flight runs (have `workflow.run.start` without matching `workflow.run.end` on the active branch) and either marks them crashed or attempts resume (depending on config).

**No separate `status.json` file** for primary state. An optional opt-in `status.json` derived artifact for CI polling is supported via `config.statusFile: true`.

### 5.7 DAG execution

The executor in `src/executor.ts`:

```ts
interface Executor {
  run(def: WorkflowDefinition, inputs: ResolvedInputs, opts: RunOpts): Promise<RunResult>;
}
```

Per-stage execution paths (each isolated to its own pi sub-session unless the workflow body explicitly uses the same context):

| Stage shape                                                        | Implementation                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctx.stage("name").prompt(text)` (default)                         | `ctx.newSession({ withSession: async (newCtx) => { const result = await newCtx.session.prompt(text); return result; } })`.                            |
| `ctx.stage("name").subagent({agent, task})` (if pi-subagents present) | Invokes the `subagent` tool through the parent session so it shows up in chat scroll naturally.                                                       |
| `ctx.stage("name").complete(text, {model})` (one-shot, no session) | Uses `complete()` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` directly — for cheap stages that don't need session tree (cross-reference: pi's `handoff.ts` example). |
| HIL — `ctx.ui.input/confirm/select/editor`                         | Pi's documented dialog methods. **Every workflow stage gets uniform HIL primitives** regardless of provider.                                          |

The `GraphFrontierTracker` (re-derived from v0.x `runtime/graph-inference.ts`) wraps `ctx.stage()` to record spawn/settle events; parent inference happens automatically from `Promise.all` (parallel) and `await` (sequential) patterns. No `dependsOn` declarations.

The executor subscribes to pi's tool-execution lifecycle to drive the widget/overlay:

```ts
pi.on("tool_execution_start",  (e, ctx) => store.recordToolStart(currentStageId, e));
pi.on("tool_execution_update", (e)      => store.recordToolUpdate(currentStageId, e));
pi.on("tool_execution_end",    (e)      => store.recordToolEnd(currentStageId, e));
```

File-mutation safety inside stages uses pi's `withFileMutationQueue(absolutePath, fn)`. Output truncation uses pi's `truncateHead`/`truncateTail`/`formatSize` exports.

### 5.8 Integration with `pi-subagents`

`pi-workflows` requires `pi-subagents` as a peer dep. At runtime, if absent, `ctx.stage(...).subagent(...)` throws a clear error pointing the user to `pi install npm:pi-subagents`.

Cooperation mechanism:
- Workflow stages that opt into sub-agent delegation call the existing `subagent` tool (registered by pi-subagents) via the chat agent driving the stage. No special API surface.
- The integration extension (`src/integrations/subagents.ts`) injects `PI_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID` and `PI_WORKFLOW_STAGE_ID` env vars when pi-subagents spawns a child process, so the child knows which workflow context it's in.
- Workflow `pi.events` (`workflow.stage.start`, `workflow.stage.end`) are emitted so pi-subagents (or other extensions) can react.

### 5.9 Integration with `pi-mcp-adapter`

`pi-workflows` requires `pi-mcp-adapter` as a peer dep. If absent, workflows still run; they just don't have MCP tools available (which the workflow's prompt or agent will discover at LLM call time).

Cooperation mechanism:
- Workflow stages inherit pi's tool list including any MCP tools `pi-mcp-adapter` has registered (direct tools) or the `mcp` proxy. Default behavior — no integration code needed.
- Optional per-stage server gating: a stage can declare `mcpServers: { allow: ["github", "fetch"], deny: ["filesystem"] }` and `src/integrations/mcp.ts` emits a `pi.events.emit("mcp.scope.set", {...})` event the adapter listens for. (This requires the adapter to expose such an event — if it doesn't yet, the integration documents the gap and we open an upstream PR to pi-mcp-adapter; we do NOT patch the adapter locally.)

### 5.10 Integration with `pi-intercom`

`pi-intercom` is optional. When absent, workflow stages cannot escalate to the user mid-run — they must complete with whatever context they have.

When present:
- `src/integrations/intercom.ts` calls `pi.setSessionName("pi-workflows-parent-<short-hash>")` on `session_start` so children have a target.
- The workflow extension subscribes to `pi.events.on("subagent:control-intercom", ...)` (pi-subagents' channel) — when a child sub-agent of a workflow stage calls `contact_supervisor`, the workflow extension surfaces it in the workflow overlay (if open) AND in the chat (`ctx.ui.confirm` for `need_decision`).
- Cross-reference: see pi-subagents' [Optional pi-intercom companion](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents/tree/main#optional-pi-intercom-companion) section.

### 5.11 Builtin workflows

Three workflows ship inside the package's `workflows/` directory (bundled via `pi: {workflows: ["./workflows"]}` in `package.json`):

| Workflow                  | Shape                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deep-research-codebase`  | Scout → per-partition specialist sub-agents (via pi-subagents) → aggregator. Each sub-agent gets a `defaultContext: "fork"` so it inherits scout's findings.        |
| `ralph`                   | Plan → orchestrate → review loop with bounded iteration. HIL via `ctx.ui.editor()` / `ctx.ui.confirm()` between iterations. Bounded iteration is a JS `for` loop.   |
| `open-claude-design`      | Design system onboarding → import → generate → refine → export/handoff. Input flags: `--reference`, `--output-type`, `--design-system`.                              |

Each builtin file imports from `pi-workflows` itself (a workspace self-reference during dev; the normal published import in user code).

**Cross-references for builtins**: the v0.x per-agent variants under `packages/atomic/src/commands/builtin-*/` (e.g., `deep-research-codebase/claude.ts`, `.../copilot.ts`, etc.) are design reference. The new versions are single workflows parameterized by model, not per-agent variants.

### 5.12 Custom workflow discovery

The registry loader scans these paths at `session_start` and on `/reload`:

1. **Built-in** — `workflows/` inside the installed `pi-workflows` package (discovered via the `pi` manifest).
2. **User-global** — `~/.pi/agent/workflows/*.ts` (or `.js`).
3. **Project-local** — `.pi/workflows/*.ts` walking up from cwd.
4. **Explicit settings entries** — `settings.json` `pi-workflows.workflows: { "<name>": { "path": "..." } }`. Project-relative paths resolve against `.pi/`, global paths against `~/.pi/agent/`.

For each file:

```ts
const mod = await import(absolutePath);   // jiti for TS, native for JS
const def = mod.default;
if (!def || def.__piWorkflow !== true) continue;  // silently skip non-workflow files
registry.upsert(def);
```

No subprocess. No metadata-emission protocol. No dispatch token.

### 5.13 Configuration

`~/.pi/agent/extensions/workflow/config.json` (Atomic's piConfig rebrand maps this to `~/.atomic/agent/...`):

```jsonc
{
  "maxDepth": 4,                              // recursion guard (env var override: PI_WORKFLOW_MAX_DEPTH)
  "defaultConcurrency": 4,                    // parallel-stage default
  "persistRuns": true,                        // pi.appendEntry on/off
  "statusFile": false,                        // opt-in derived status.json for CI
  "resumeInFlight": "ask",                    // "ask" | "auto" | "never" on session_start
  "overlay": {
    "autoOpenOnStart": false,                 // open overlay automatically when a run begins
    "anchor": "center"
  },
  "integrations": {
    "subagents": "auto",                      // "auto" | "off"
    "mcp": "auto",
    "intercom": "auto"
  }
}
```

All keys optional with sane defaults.

### 5.14 Testing strategy

`pi-workflows` is testable **against the user's installed pi binary directly** — no Atomic rebuild needed. The package's `package.json` includes:

```jsonc
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "bun build src/index.ts --outdir dist --target node",
    "test": "bun test",
    "test:e2e": "PI_BIN=$(which pi) bun test test/e2e",
    "dev:link": "bun link && cd ~/some-test-project && bun link pi-workflows && pi install ./dist"
  }
}
```

Test tiers:

1. **Unit** (`test/unit/`): `defineWorkflow` builder shape, registry semantics, input validation, graph-inference algorithm against synthetic stage call sequences, persistence-entry shape.
2. **Integration** (`test/integration/`): the package's `default` function registers tools/commands/renderers correctly against a `MockExtensionAPI`. Workflow execution against a mock pi-ai `complete()` for deterministic stage outputs.
3. **E2E against installed pi** (`test/e2e/`): for each builtin workflow, run `pi -p --no-session --workflow=<name> --workflow-input-prompt='...'` in a fixture directory; assert the JSONL output stream contains expected `workflow.*` events. Requires `pi` on PATH.

Pi's existing test conventions apply: `CLAUDECODE=1` / `AGENT=1` / `REPL_ID=1` env vars enable quiet output.

## 6. Alternatives Considered

| Option                                                            | Why considered                                                                                                              | Why rejected                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundle workflow runtime into Atomic, not as an npm package       | Less surface to publish/maintain.                                                                                            | Misses the user's stated framing (pi-workflows is structurally a sibling of pi-subagents — publishable to pi ecosystem). |
| Build on top of pi-subagents' chain abstraction instead of new tool | pi-subagents already does chains and parallel.                                                                                | Chains are linear/parallel; workflows need fan-in topology, programmatic input schemas, and per-stage HIL beyond pi-subagents' frontmatter. |
| Use pi's RPC mode for cross-process workflow execution            | Decouples workflow runner from chat TUI.                                                                                     | Adds an IPC layer for no benefit — both run in the same process. RPC mode is for OTHER consumers of pi.              |
| Programmatic `runWorkflow()` Node API                              | Lets external Node scripts trigger workflows.                                                                                | External scripts shell out to `pi -p --workflow=<name>`. One less API surface to maintain.                            |
| Inherit type-system from typebox vs. zod                           | Pi's tool params already use typebox; consistency.                                                                            | Selected typebox to match pi (no decision; aligns with sibling packages).                                            |

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 7.1 Security

- Workflow files run with full Node access (they're imported as modules). Same security model as pi extensions and pi-subagents agent definitions. Pi's "review packages before installing" warning applies.
- Custom workflow paths in user settings = user trust signal. No dispatch token.
- Sub-agents launched by workflow stages inherit pi-subagents' security model (recursion guard, tool allow-listing, etc.).

### 7.2 Observability

- Every run/stage entry in the session JSONL is timestamped and labeled.
- Optional telemetry sink (`src/lib/telemetry.ts`) emits anonymous run-count / stage-duration / failure-rate stats. The package ships **no production sink**; the consuming binary (e.g., Atomic) wires one if it wants.
- `/workflows-doctor` slash command reports config validity, registry contents, sibling availability.

### 7.3 Performance

- Single-process; no IPC overhead per stage.
- DAG inference is O(stages); graph layout for overlay is O(stages × levels) — well under any human-relevant size.
- Compaction: long-running workflows that exhaust the context window trigger pi's auto-compaction. The extension installs `session_before_compact` to preserve workflow state across compactions (cross-reference: the same pattern pi-subagents uses for fork-context children — upstream issue #147).

## 8. Migration, Rollout, and Testing

### 8.1 Development phasing

Each phase is a working commit; `pi install <local-path>` against the user's pi binary should work at every phase boundary.

- **Phase 0 — Wipe**: Single commit on a new branch `rewrite/clean-slate` deletes everything except the kept docs (§2.4). Tag the previous HEAD as `v0.x-archive` first so cross-references survive. After this commit the working tree contains only `docs/`, `specs/`, `research/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`.
- **Phase A — Skeleton**: Create `packages/pi-workflows/` with `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `bunfig.toml`. Add minimal root `package.json` + `bunfig.toml` + `tsconfig.json` declaring the workspace. `src/extension/index.ts` empty default export, `src/workflows/define-workflow.ts` + `src/workflows/registry.ts` (authoring API only, no extension behavior yet). Publishable as a no-op package that exports types. Tests: unit only.
- **Phase B — Tool + commands**: Register `workflow` tool with stub `execute`, register `/workflow` slash command, register CLI flag. Inline renderers via `pi.registerMessageRenderer`. Tests: integration via `MockExtensionAPI`.
- **Phase C — Executor**: `src/executor.ts` + `GraphFrontierTracker` re-derivation. Single-stage workflows work end-to-end against installed pi. Tests: e2e for a trivial workflow that runs one `ctx.stage().prompt()`.
- **Phase D — Persistence + restore**: `pi.appendEntry` for run/stage events; restore on `session_start`. `/workflow status`, `/workflow kill`, `/workflow resume` slash commands.
- **Phase E — Live UI**: Above-editor widget, `tool_execution_*` event subscriptions, working spinner/title messages.
- **Phase F — Overlay**: `ctx.ui.custom({overlay: true})` DAG visualization. Keyboard nav. Status filter modes.
- **Phase G — Sibling integrations**: `src/integrations/{subagents,mcp,intercom}.ts`. Verify each peer dep against the user's installed pi.
- **Phase H — Builtins**: Reauthor `deep-research-codebase`, `ralph`, `open-claude-design` as single-model definitions. Each builtin's previous per-agent variants under v0.x `packages/atomic/src/commands/builtin-*/` are cross-referenced for intent.
- **Phase I — Documentation + release**: README, examples in `examples/`, CHANGELOG, first npm publish (`pi-workflows@0.1.0`).
- **Phase J — Polish based on dogfooding**: Iterate against real use against the user's pi binary.

### 8.2 Distribution

- npm: `pi-workflows` (unscoped; matches sibling naming conventions).
- License: MIT.
- The package follows the pi-package manifest convention (`keywords: ["pi-package"]`, `pi: { extensions, workflows }` in `package.json`).
- Atomic consumes via `packages: [{ source: "npm:pi-workflows", lifecycle: "auto" }]` declared in its bundled default settings (sibling spec).

### 8.3 Test plan summary

- Phase A: unit tests for `defineWorkflow` builder + registry.
- Phase B: integration test that registering against `MockExtensionAPI` produces the expected tool/command/renderer registrations.
- Phase C–F: e2e tests against installed pi for each new capability.
- Phase G: integration tests with each sibling installed (matrix: pi-subagents only, pi-mcp-adapter only, all three).
- Phase H: per-builtin smoke test that the workflow runs to completion against a mock provider.

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Package naming**: `pi-workflows` (unscoped, matches siblings) vs `@atomic/pi-workflows` (scoped). Default: `pi-workflows` unscoped.
2. **`peerDependencies` strictness**: declare `pi-subagents`/`pi-mcp-adapter`/`pi-intercom` as `peerDependenciesMeta.optional: true` (recommended — workflows still work without them, just with degraded features) vs. hard requires.
3. **`PI_WORKFLOW_MAX_DEPTH` default**: pi-subagents defaults to 2; workflows tend to be flatter (one workflow rarely spawns another). Default 4 keeps headroom; revisit after dogfooding.
4. **Per-stage MCP server gating**: requires an upstream PR to pi-mcp-adapter for a `pi.events`-based scope-set API. If upstream rejects, do we live without it (acceptable) or fall back to a settings-level static config that toggles before-run?
5. **Builtin `ralph` rename**: keep `ralph` as the workflow ID (per Atomic-spec Q11) or rename to something neutral. Default: keep.
6. **Workflow definition file extension**: `.ts` (default, with jiti) vs. supporting `.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` too. Default: TS + JS.
7. **Session-name strategy for pi-intercom**: hardcoded `pi-workflows-parent-<hash>` vs. configurable. Default: derive from cwd hash.

Every box is a pi primitive. No bespoke IPC. No sidecar state files.
