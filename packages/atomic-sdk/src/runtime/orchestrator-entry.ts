/**
 * SDK-owned orchestrator entry script.
 *
 * Run as the tmux pane command for every workflow spawned by `runWorkflow`.
 * Reads the workflow source path, agent, and base64-encoded inputs from
 * positional argv, imports the workflow module, validates the default
 * export, and hands off to `runOrchestrator()`.
 *
 * Argv layout (after `bun <this-file>`):
 *   argv[2] = absolute path to the workflow's source file
 *             (the `source` field from `defineWorkflow({ source: ... })`)
 *   argv[3] = agent — one of "claude" | "copilot" | "opencode"
 *   argv[4] = base64-encoded JSON record of structured inputs
 *
 * The dev's CLI never re-imports its own argv[1] — there's no
 * `ATOMIC_ORCHESTRATOR_MODE` env var, no `handleOrchestratorReentry()`,
 * no boilerplate. This file is the only re-exec target.
 *
 * The remaining ATOMIC_WF_* env vars (ID, TMUX, AGENT, CWD) are still set
 * by the launcher script written by `executeWorkflow()` — they describe
 * the runtime environment (which tmux session, which workflow run id,
 * etc.) rather than acting as a re-entry signal.
