 * env at spawn time, so scoping the override around `createOpencode(...)`
 * is enough to influence the subprocess without leaking into later work.
 *
 * A reference counter keeps the override in place while any concurrent
 * headless spawn is still running — otherwise two parallel stages can
 * race, and the second one restores the first one's already-overridden
 * value as if it were the original. The captured "pre-override" state is
 * only read on the outermost entry and only replayed on the outermost
